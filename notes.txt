1. Followed the first part of this tutorial:
https://medium.com/bucharestjs/upgrading-a-create-react-app-project-to-a-ssr-code-splitting-setup-9da57df2040a

2. Set NODE_ENV = development

3. Ran npm run build

TODO:

1. Get comfortable with everything in server directory
2. Read docs on npm run build  - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment
3. Continue with tutorial from above, may need to flesh out some basic components and routing first
