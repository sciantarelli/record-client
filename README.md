The primary objective of this project is to provide a suite of organizational and productivity tools catering to my own specific needs. 

After years of tinkering with various products, I've never found an all-in-one solution for organizing my digital existence that I'm content with. I needed a solution where components such as notes, bookmarks, research, ideas, and more could not only be captured, but additionally tagged (from a single source of tags) and cross-referenced with each other in an effective manner.

This repository contains only the frontend code, with the exception of a lightweight Node server to enable server-side rendering. It is intended to be used in conjunction with my [record-api](https://github.com/sciantarelli/record-api) project, but could be modified to work with other API's with little effort.
